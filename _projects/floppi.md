Floppi is an Android app that lets you browse, search, and sort your saved posts from Reddit. Finding old saved posts on
Reddit can be a challenging task - sometimes near impossible. Normally, Reddit lets you scroll through your saved posts 25 at a time,
from most recently saved to oldest, and that's it. With Floppi you can narrow down the list with a search, sort the list
in different orders, include or exclude subreddits from the list, or even all of the above at the same time! Visit the Floppi
website [here](/floppi).

(The vidoes below were made when the app was called Saveddit. I changed the name.)

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/scroll.gif" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
        <div class="caption">
            View
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">

<!-- TODO:
    - A section for key features (Browse, Search, Sort, log-in securely, refresh), break up the gifs 1 per section (maybe record a refresh gif).
    - A section for skills developed (new and old). stuff like Android, Kotlin, HTTPS, JSON, Oauth2, Gerrit, Clean Modular code, etc
