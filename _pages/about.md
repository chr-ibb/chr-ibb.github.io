Hello, I'm Chris. I'm a Junior Software Engineer, with a recent focus in Android development. I love solving problems, learning, and working as part of a team, so software engineering is a great match. While I'm mostly self-taught, I had a strong foundation - I took a handful of CS classes while pursuing my Bachelor's in Geophysics at UC Berkeley, and I absolutely loved them (the Berkeley EECS staff are the best). I've got more small or unfinished projects than I'd care to admit, but I'm proud to say that I've finished my biggest project yet: my Reddit companion app Saveddit (link). I also fixed a [bug](https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/frameworks/support/+/2163645) in the Android codebase, which is cool.

Whether it's playing Dota pubs with the homies, booting up Slippi for some Melee action, or running an RL1 in Elden Ring, I'm an avid video game enjoyer. If it's Sunday night, I'm most likely at the local park playing basketball (if you're in the area, come join!). My favorite films include Chunking Express, Science of Sleep, and Jurassic Park (it's a masterpiece; go rewatch it). I also have a passion for music (link to my guest DJ set on KPFK), and will probably put out an album... eventually... maybe...

I'm looking forward to continuing to grow as a software engineer, taking on new and exciting roles, finally going back to Japan (host families, I miss you <3), and probably-most-likely-maybe putting out an album.
