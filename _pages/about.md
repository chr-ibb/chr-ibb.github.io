Hello, I'm Chris. I'm a Software Engineer. I'm mostly self-taught, though I did take a handful of CS classes while studying at UC Berkeley. I recently finished my biggest project yet, my Reddit companion app [Floppi](/projects/floppi). I also fixed a [bug](https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/frameworks/support/+/2163645) in the Android codebase, which is cool.
