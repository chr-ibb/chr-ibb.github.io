<h2 align="center">Q & A</h2>

<blockquote>I saved a post a really long time ago, why can't I see it in Floppi?</blockquote>

The Reddit API will only ever show you your last 1000 saved things. This limitation even exists on their own site! Reddit still knows what posts you've saved before those 1000 (if you unsave 10 posts, itll show you  10 more), so theoretically a tool could be made to unsave every saved post, store them all, and then resave them all. Let me know if you'd be interested in that.

<blockquote>Can you connect more than one Reddit account using Floppi?</blockquote>

Yes! After adding an account in Floppi, try logging out of that account in chrome, and then go back into Floppi and add the second account.
This was easier in a previous version, but ever since moving to the more secure Chrome Custom Tab for adding accounts, this workaround is required. If you know a better way, please let me know!

<blockquote>Does Floppi sell my info, or anything like that? Does Floppi store my info in the cloud?</blockquote>

No. Floppi saves your username, 0auth token, and list of reddit posts directly on your phone. That's it!

<blockquote>Is it safe to enter my Reddit password into Floppi?</blockquote>

Yes. When you add your Reddit account to Floppi, you're actually entering your login info into a Chrome Custom Tab on Reddit's official website! Reddit then gives Floppi a token to use in place of your password, which Floppi stores securely on the phone.
